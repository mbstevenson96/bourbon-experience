## Ice Box:
* AAU I want to select from a drop down the type of spirit I would like to add and then fields are populated for myself to fill out based on the spirit I selected.
* AAU I want to become the owner of a wish list bottle I add to my wish list from another user's added bottles.
* AAU I want to be able to set my overall preferences so my friends can see what I generally like.
* AAU I want a section that displays all distilleries on the Kentucky Bourbon Trail where I can check off ones I have been to.
* AAU I want to be able to add what I have tried at each distillery on the Kentucky Bourbon Trail list. 
* AAU I want a list where I can store information on liquor stores I have visted so I can visit them again.
* AAU I want to be able to use a barcode scanner to add bottles to my wish list or inventory.
