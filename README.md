## Ice Box:
* Refactor to a spirits app where a user can select the type of spirit they're inputting and it populates input fields based on their selection.
* When a user "adds bottle to wish list" they become the owner of their wish list bottle. 
* Have an area where users can set their overall preferences for certain spirits.
* Create a section on a user's profile where it shows all distilleries on the Kentucky Bourbon Trail and allows the user to check off which ones they have gone to.
* Users can input what they tasted at different distilleries on the Kentucky Bourbon Trail along with notes on those tastings and attach them to their visited distilleries on the Kentucky Bourbon Trail. 
* Visited liquor store list curated by the user where they can input location information of liquor stores they have visited and would like to visit again. 
* Add a barcode scanner where the user can scan the barcode of a bottle and it auto populates the information into the input fields.
